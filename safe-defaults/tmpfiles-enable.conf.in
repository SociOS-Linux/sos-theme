# systemd-tmpfiles --create --remove is invoked for this file when a
# "safe defaults" system is upgraded, or when eos-safe-defaults enable
# is run manually. this means if any link or file is removed from this
# list, it should be replaced with an r to avoid any dangling symlinks.
# note that systemd-tmpfiles r fails to remove a dangling symlink, so
# if a symlinked config file in the ostree is no longer needed it should
# be made empty rather than deleted, otherwise the change from L to r
# in this file will be ineffective.
